    "You are working for a non-profit that is recruiting student volunteers to help with Alzheimer's patients. You have been tasked with predicting how suitable a person is for this task by predicting how empathetic he or she is. Using the Young People Survey dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/), predict a person's \"Empathy\" as either \"very empathetic\" (answers 4 and 5) or \"not very empathetic\" (answers 1, 2, and 3). You can use any of the other attributes in the dataset to make this prediction; however, you should not handpick the predictive features but let an algorithm select them. "
