# Empathy Classification

Classification of people into empathetic and non-empathetic using the Young People Survey dataset.

---

This is a mini-project created as part of the **CS 412 - Introduction to Machine Learning** course, taught by Professor Elena Zheleva, at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

## Problem Statement

You are working for a non-profit that is recruiting student volunteers to help with Alzheimer's patients. You have been tasked with predicting how suitable a person is for this task by predicting how empathetic he or she is. Using the Young People Survey dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/), predict a person's "Empathy" as either "very empathetic" (answers 4 and 5) or "not very empathetic" (answers 1, 2, and 3). You can use any of the other attributes in the dataset to make this prediction; however, you should not handpick the predictive features but let an algorithm select them. 

## How to run?

1. Download the [Young People Survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/) from Kaggle
2. Extract the 2 CSV files - `columns.csv` and `responses.csv` - and place them in a new `data` folder in the root directory of the project
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and open `hw5.ipynb` notebook
4. Go to `Cell` -> `Run All`

## Write-up

The one page write-up file is named `hw5_writeup.pdf`, and can be found in the root directory of the project

## Extra-credit

The notebook for extra-credits, named `hw5_extra-credit.ipynb`, can be found in the root directory of the project.
